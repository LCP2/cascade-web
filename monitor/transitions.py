"""Core diff logic: yesterday's catalogue + today's -> per-movie transitions.

Pure and side-effect free (no network, no disk writes) so it unit-tests cleanly and
the caller (the daily job) owns all I/O.

A *transition* is one movie crossing into one *moment*. The four moments mirror the
``alert_moments`` a Cascade stores (see supabase/schema.sql and the front-end
``CascadeShape`` mapping in app_template.html):

    hits_cinema           — the film's theatrical window opened (status gained "in_cinema")
    hits_pvod             — it reached premium home video: buy, or rent above the standard rental
                            ceiling (status gained "pvod"). Added by CAS-103 so the editor's
                            Purchase button drives a moment that can really fire — before that it
                            was a UI-only toggle wired to nothing.
    hits_rent             — it became available to rent (status gained "rental")
    hits_stream           — it landed on an included/free streaming service (status gained
                            "included_streaming")
    past_opening_weekend  — today is exactly ``opening_date + N`` days (N=4, tunable). This is
                            NOT a catalogue diff: it's computed from the film's REAL cinema
                            date, so it only ever fires on real dates (honesty guardrail; ref CAS-68).
    announced             — a title Cascade has never held before arrived, and it is UNRELEASED. Added by
                            CAS-242 for the cinema agent's Upcoming bell. It is the one moment a first
                            sighting legitimately IS the news: for every other moment a first sighting would
                            be reporting state that was simply already true, which is why they are guarded,
                            but "a film worth knowing about has turned up" is a change from the reader's
                            side too. What it is NOT is the studio's announcement date — nobody publishes
                            that — so the front end says "first reaches Cascade" and the email says the same.
    opens_soon            — today is exactly ``opening_date - N`` days (N=7, tunable). Computed from the
                            film's own published date, the mirror of past_opening_weekend, and like it it
                            can only ever fire on a real date.
    newly_qualifies       — a film already held in BOTH catalogues whose own attributes changed so it now
                            matches an agent's criteria and did not yesterday (CAS-602): an IMDb rating
                            crossing the bar, a metacritic score/award/gross arriving, a genre/age
                            correction. NOT produced here — there is no catalogue transition to hang it
                            off, since the film was already held — it is agent-dependent and computed
                            during matching (see ``monitor.matching.match_newly_qualified``).

Honesty guardrail: the three status moments only fire on a *genuine transition* — the film
must have been in yesterday's catalogue and NOT already in that window. A film's very first
sighting never fires an alert (you'd be "notified" about state that was simply already true).
